# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-02)

**Core value:** Every week of your life deserves a card -- quick capture in the moment, AI-synthesized reflection when you're ready.
**Current focus:** Phase 3: Capture

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 5 (Capture)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Ready for Phase 3
Last activity: 2026-03-03 -- Completed 02-02-PLAN.md

Progress: [####......] 40%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 3.5min
- Total execution time: 0.23 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-data-foundation | 2 | 9min | 4.5min |
| 02-grid-and-card-views | 2 | 4min | 2min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (4min), 01-02 (5min), 02-01 (2min), 02-02 (2min)
- Trend: Accelerating

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 phases derived from requirements -- Foundation, Grid+Card, Capture, AI Synthesis, Onboarding+Polish
- [Roadmap]: CARD requirements split across Phase 2 (structure/flip) and Phase 4 (AI-dependent content and toggle)
- [01-01]: Dexie v4 with explicit version(1) schema for future migration support
- [01-01]: Compound index [weekId+createdAt] on entries for sorted per-week queries
- [01-01]: Settings store uses key (not UUID) as primary key for simple key-value lookups
- [01-01]: DeviceId auto-generated on first visit for future sync readiness
- [01-02]: Week 1 starts on 2007-07-01 (corrected from plan's 2007-08-19 math error)
- [01-02]: All date constructors use local timezone to avoid UTC/local mismatches
- [01-02]: Zustand store is intentionally minimal -- only selectedWeekNumber for now
- [02-01]: 52 columns per row (one row ~ one year) for intuitive year-axis reading
- [02-01]: Row-level virtualization with TanStack Virtual -- 52 cells per row is lightweight enough
- [02-01]: Responsive cell sizing: 7px mobile, 11px desktop
- [02-02]: Spring physics for flip animation (stiffness: 200, damping: 30) for natural card-flipping feel
- [02-02]: Graceful degradation: CardFront shows only week number + date range when no synthesis exists
- [02-02]: Click-to-flip interaction with visual hint text that guides first-time users
