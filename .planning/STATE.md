## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 phases derived from requirements -- Foundation, Grid+Card, Capture, AI Synthesis, Onboarding+Polish
- [Roadmap]: CARD requirements split across Phase 2 (structure/flip) and Phase 4 (AI-dependent content and toggle)
- [01-01]: Dexie v4 with explicit version(1) schema for future migration support
- [01-01]: Compound index [weekId+createdAt] on entries for sorted per-week queries
- [01-01]: Settings store uses key (not UUID) as primary key for simple key-value lookups
- [01-01]: DeviceId auto-generated on first visit for future sync readiness
- [01-02]: Week 1 starts on 2007-07-01 (corrected from plan's 2007-08-19 math error)
- [01-02]: All date constructors use local timezone to avoid UTC/local mismatches
- [01-02]: Zustand store is intentionally minimal -- only selectedWeekNumber for now
